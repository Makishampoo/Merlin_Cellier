            <div class="FromSoftware">
                <p>2000s<br>
                With the launch of the PlayStation 2 in 2000, FromSoftware released the role-playing games Eternal Ring and Evergrace. In 2003, FromSoftware published Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, a stealth game that
                combines action and adventure elements.<br>
                In 2004, FromSoftware bought the rights to the series from Activision. The company also released King's Field IV and Shadow Tower Abyss, in addition to the Lost Kingdoms series for the GameCube.
                The company also made a few games exclusive to the Xbox around this time, such as Murakumo: Renegade Mech Pursuit, Otogi: Myth of Demons, Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors, Metal Wolf Chaos, and Chromehounds
                In 2005, FromSoftware would start to produce a series of licensed games based on the various anime properties under the banner Another Century's Episode.
                The same year, the company hosted the video game industry's first internship that let students experience game development through a game creation kit, Adventure Player, for the PlayStation Portable.
                In May 2008, FromSoftware underwent a stock split.<br>
                
                2010s<br>
                FromSoftware achieved breakout success in the 2010s,
                spurred by the release of Demon's Souls (2009) and Dark Souls (2011), the latter being the first entry in a trilogy whose success led to the creation of a subgenre of action role-playing games known as Soulslike games.
                These include Dark Souls II (2014), Bloodborne (2015),Dark Souls III (2016), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019), and Elden Ring (2022), which have all received several awards and are often listed among the greatest video games of all time.
                In April 2014, Kadokawa Corporation announced its intention to purchase the company from former shareholder Transcosmos. Following other restructuring,
                In January 2016, FromSoftware established a studio in Fukuoka that focuses on creating computer-generated imagery (CGI) assets for their games.<br> 
                
                2020s<br>
                In August 2022, Sixjoy Hong Kong (a subsidiary of Tencent) and Sony Interactive Entertainment respectively acquired 16.25% and 14.09% of FromSoftware, leaving 69.66% to Kadokawa. A November 2022 report by GamesIndustry.biz claimed that FromSoftware was paying their employees at sub-standard rates.
                In October 2024, the developer announced a salary increase of approximately 12% for its employees.
